# this pArt (Cloud Castle Edition)

## About this project:
- An app for users to share public art pieces on a map for other users.
- A motivation is to promote Art Education as well as artist and organizations creating and displaying public art around the world.

## Inspirations for this project:
- A strong interest in creating dynamic web maps.
- A love of public art and the belief that it can help communities around the world.
- The idea of creating a web map of photos of public art first came while travelling in Mexico City, before I knew JavaScript.
- I was reminded of this idea while walking around SOHO shortly after the marches and riots spurred by the killing of George Floyd. The bordered up buildings were covered with art which conveyed themes of social justice, anger, unity, information, among others. I felt like I was walking through a large public gallery and thankfully took photos.
- ...and now, here you are, and here I am, at 'this pArt', which I guess stands for "this public art"
